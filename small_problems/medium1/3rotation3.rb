# If you take a number like 735291, and rotate it to the left, you get 352917. If you now keep the first digit fixed in place, and rotate the remaining digits, you get 329175. Keep the first 2 digits fixed in place and rotate again to 321759. Keep the first 3 digits fixed in place and rotate again to get 321597. Finally, keep the first 4 digits fixed in place and rotate the final 2 digits to get 321579. The resulting number is called the maximum rotation of the original number.

# really proud of this one too. quite stumped for a bit but worked through it
