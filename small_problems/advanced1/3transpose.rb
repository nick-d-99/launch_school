# Write a method that takes a 3 x 3 matrix in Array of Arrays format and returns the transpose of the original matrix. Note that there is a Array#transpose method that does this -- you may not use it for this exercise. You also are not allowed to use the Matrix class from the standard library. Your task is to do this yourself.

# Take care not to modify the original matrix: you must produce a new matrix and leave the original matrix unchanged.

def transpose(mat)
  sol = [[], [], []]
  mat.each_with_index do |arr, arr_idx|
    arr.each_with_index do |val, idx|
      sol[arr_idx][idx] = mat[idx][arr_idx]
    end
  end
  sol
end

matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
]

new_matrix = transpose(matrix)

p new_matrix == [[1, 4, 3], [5, 7, 9], [8, 2, 6]]
p matrix == [[1, 5, 8], [4, 7, 2], [3, 9, 6]]
