# A triangle is classified as follows:

#     equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
#     isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
#     scalene All 3 sides are of different length

# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.

  sides = [s1, s2, s3]
  return :invalid if sides.include?(0)

  sides.sort!
  return :invalid if sides[0] + sides[1] <= sides[2]

    if sides[0] == sides[1] && sides[1] == sides[2]
