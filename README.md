This repo is created to start the Launch School cirriculum. I started this at 6:37pm on 1/10/2023.

RB101 Programming Foundations are lessons and guided exercises with the accompanied Launch School book.

Small Problems are independent exercises for practice. RB101 instructs when to do which sets of exercises.
