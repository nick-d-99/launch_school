The result of the following statement will be an error:

puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)

Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

The result of (40 + 2) is an integer and not a string so concatenation is not possible.

This can be fixed using type casting:
(40 + 2).to_s

or

using formatting:
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
