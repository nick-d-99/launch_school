Let's take a look at another example with a small difference in the code:

a = 42
b = 42
c = a

puts a.object_id
==> 00

puts b.object_id
==> 01

puts c.object_id
==> 00

I did not know that integers are immutable values in Ruby meaning the object ID of an integer will
remain the same regardless of when or where it is called or instantiated. The same with True, False, and
nil.
