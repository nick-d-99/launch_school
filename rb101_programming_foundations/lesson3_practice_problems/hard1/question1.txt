What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

greeting

there would be an error because greeting is never declared due to 'if false' always evaluating to 'false'
so line 4 is never executed and there is no greeting variable.
