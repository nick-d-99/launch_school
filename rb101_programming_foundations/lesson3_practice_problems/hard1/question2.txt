What is the result of the last line in the code below?

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings

the result is printing the contents of the greetings dictionary
this dictionary is unaltered

incorrect but i fell for the trap the question was trying to highlight

'informal_greeting = greetings[:a]' is a reference to the object so whatever is done to this variable
is done to the original value

the actual output would be { a=> 'hi there' }
